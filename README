NO3M modifications to SDR-SHELL v4.25

Partial list:

* Ability to capture / snapshot GUI automatically or on-demand, saved as PNG to configurable dirctory [main config: General]

* Add hardware gain config option (calls setGain and sets input gain) [main config: IQ]

* Major changes to spectrum and spectrogram:

  > zooming does not changes font size, etc.
  > moved Spectrum above spectrogram
  > Many spectrogram color palette options (ie. WSJTX, FLDigi, GMFSK, Rocky, etc.) [main config: Spectrum]
  > custom color for spectrum
  > Spectrum dots, lines (connect dots), fill w/ solid or gradient option, peak markers, average line options [main config: Spectrum]
  > Spectrum normal, average, and peak modes [button on bottom panel = SPEC NORM, etc.]
  > Waterfall normal and moving average modes [button on bottom panel = WF NORM, etc.], num samples configurable
  > Waterfall time markers /w automatic period [main config: Spectrum]
  > Manual or automatic aperature settings for waterfall (ie. gain and contrast) [MAN/AUTO button bottom panel]  
  > Numerous spectrogram scrolling options [main config: Spectrum]:
    * Waterfall down / up
    * Linrad style normal and reverse
    * SDR-shell style normal or reverse
  > changed inhernet zooming rendering 
    * spectrogram: QImage scaling w/ fast transformation
    * spectrum: decimate w/ max (zoom > 1.0), interpolate w/ linear sloop (zoom < 1.0)

* frequency scale under spectum

  > mouse scroolwheel zooming (increments by factor of +/- 0.1)
  > middle click resets to 1:1 zoom
  > left click / hover same as spectorgram / spectrum

* frequency at mouse location over spectrum/spectrogram/frequency-scale is rounded to nearest step size (selected LCD readout)

* spectrum/spectrogram/frequency-scale left click to change frequency is rounded to nearest step size (selected LCD digit)

* added AGC off back in, also sets output gain to compensate

* added preamp and attenuator buttons (both configurable gain - right click to set) [DSP: Gain]

* added noise blanker #2 (ie. SDROM) (right click NB2 to set parameters) [DSP: NB}

* added receive spot tone with user configurable parameters [main config: General]

* tuning direction same for softrock vs. rockbound modes

* fixed memory read/write/display issues w/ rockbound mode

* UTC time displayed under logo
